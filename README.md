Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I am currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics from UCLA Anderson School of Management. At my core, I am a Data Science Engineer with a passion to create products that can automate mundane tasks or create an impact by overcoming business challenges.

A few things about me:
- ðŸŒ± I am very interested in the Behavioral Sciences and Consumer Psychology. I published a paper to understand the change in the factors that make an individual susceptible to cyberbullying due to the pandemic based on their social media activity and their personal understanding of what qualifies as cyberbullying. It can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958820300294 
- âš¡ My hobbies include discovering new genres and music artists, reading historic dramas and watching criminal documentaries/ crime dramas.
